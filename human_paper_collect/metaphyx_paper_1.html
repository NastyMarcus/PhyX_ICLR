Figure shows the transitions involved to form the red beam and the green beam. After a population inversion is established, neon atoms make a variety of downward transitions in falling from the state labeled \( E_4^* \) down eventually to level \( E_1 \) (arbitrarily assigned the energy \( E_1 = 0 \)). The atoms emit both red light with a wavelength of 632.8 nm in a transition \( E_4^* - E_3 \) and green light with a wavelength of 543 nm in a competing transition \( E_4^* - E_2 \). What is the energy \( E_2 \)? Assume the atoms are in a cavity between mirrors designed to reflect the green light with high efficiency but to allow the red light to leave the cavity immediately. Then stimulated emission can lead to the buildup of a collimated beam of green light between the mirrors having a greater intensity than that of the red light. To constitute the radiated laser beam, a small fraction of the green light is permitted to escape by transmission through one mirror. The mirrors forming the resonant cavity can be made of layers of silicon dioxide (index of refraction \( n = 1.458 \)) and titanium dioxide (index of refraction varies between 1.9 and 2.6).</p>
