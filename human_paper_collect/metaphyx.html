First you place a square of white cardboard to the right of the object and find what its distance from the vertex needs to be so that the image is sharply focused on it. Next you measure the height of the sharply focused images for five values of $s$. For each $s$ value, you then calculate the lateral magnification $m$.

Your result is the pattern of closely spaced bright and dark fringes shown in figure. (Only the central portion of the pattern is shown.) You measure that the bright spots are equally spaced at 1.53 cm center to center (except for the missing spots) on a screen that is 2.50 m from the slits. The light source was a helium-neon laser producing a wavelength of 632.8 nm. How wide is each one?</p>

An example is the bright object below and to the left of center in figure; the other elongated objects in this image are normal galaxies. The leading model for the structure of a quasar is a galaxy with a supermassive black hole at its center. In this model, the radiation is emitted by interstellar gas and dust within the galaxy as this material falls toward the black hole. The radiation is thought to emanate from a region just a few light-years in diameter. (The diffuse glow surrounding the bright quasar shown in figure is thought to be this quasar's host galaxy.) To investigate this model of quasars and to study other exotic astronomical objects, the Russian Space Agency has placed a radio telescope in a large orbit around the earth. When this telescope is 77,000 km from earth and the signals it receives are combined with signals from the ground-based telescopes of the VLBA, the resolution is that of a single radio telescope 77,000 km in diameter. This arrangement can resolve in quasar 3C 405, which is $7.2 \times 10^8$ light-years from earth, using radio waves at a frequency of 1665 MHz. Give your answer in light-years and in kilometers. What is the size of the smallest detail?</p>

Figure shows two parallel antennas separated by distance $L$. Both antennas broadcast a signal at wavelength $\lambda$, but antenna 2 can delay its broadcast relative to antenna 1 by a time interval $\Delta t$ in order to create a phase difference $\Delta \phi_0$ between the sources. Your task is to find values of $L$ and $\Delta t$ such that the waves interfere constructively on the town side and destructively on the country side. Let antenna 1 be at $x = 0$. The wave that travels to the right is $a \sin[2\pi (x/\lambda - t/T)]$. The left wave is $a \sin[2\pi (-x/\lambda - t/T)]$. (It must be this, rather than $a \sin[2\pi (x/\lambda + t/T)]$, so that the two waves match at $x = 0$.) Antenna 2 is at $x = L$. It broadcasts wave $a \sin[2\pi ((x - L)/\lambda - t/T) + \phi_{20}]$ to the right and wave $a \sin[2\pi (-(x - L)/\lambda - t/T) + \phi_{20}]$ to the left.

This spreading is done by longitudinal and transverse pulses that move radially from the impact point, where the projectile pushes a cone-shaped dent into the fabric. The longitudinal pulse, racing along the fibers of the fabric at speed \(v_l\) ahead of the denting, causes the fibers to thin and stretch, with material flowing radially inward into the dent. One such radial fiber is shown in figure. Part of the projectile's energy goes into this motion and stretching. The transverse pulse, moving at a slower speed \(v_t\), is due to the denting. As the projectile increases the dent's depth, the dent increases in radius, causing the material in the fibers to move in the same direction as the projectile (perpendicular to the transverse pulse's direction of travel). The rest of the projectile's energy goes into this motion. All the energy that does not eventually go into permanently deforming the fibers ends up as thermal energy.

Figure is a graph of speed \(v\) versus time \(t\) for a bullet of mass \(10.2\,\mathrm{g}\) fired from a .38 Special revolver directly into body armor. The scales of the vertical and horizontal axes are set by \(v_s = 300\,\mathrm{m/s}\) and \(t_s = 40.0\,\mu\mathrm{s}\).

Moreover, ultrasound can be used to measure the speed of the blood in the body; it does so by comparing the frequency of the ultrasound sent into the body with the frequency of the ultrasound reflected back to the body's surface by the blood. As the blood pulses, this detected frequency varies.

Suppose that an ultrasound image of the arm of a patient shows an artery that is angled at \(\theta = 20^\circ\) to the ultrasound's line of travel. Suppose also that the frequency of the ultrasound reflected by the blood in the artery is increased by a maximum of \(5495\,\mathrm{Hz}\) from the original ultrasound frequency of \(5.000\,000\,\mathrm{MHz}\). The speed of sound in the human arm is \(1540\,\mathrm{m/s}\). What is the maximum speed of the blood?</p>

Seismic waves produced by its impact with the ground triggered seismographs as far away as $200$ km. Later measurements indicated that the block had a mass between $7.3 \times 10^7$ kg and $1.7 \times 10^8$ kg and that it landed $500$ m vertically below the launch point and $30$ m horizontally from it. Consider two types of seismic waves that spread from the impact point—a hemispherical \textit{body wave} traveled through the ground in an expanding hemisphere and a cylindrical \textit{surface wave} traveled along the ground in an expanding shallow vertical cylinder. Assume that the impact lasted \(0.50\,\mathrm{s}\), the vertical cylinder had a depth \(d = 5.0\,\mathrm{m}\), and each wave type received 20\% of the energy the block had just before impact. Neglecting any mechanical energy loss the waves experienced as they traveled, determine the intensities of the surface wave when they reached a seismograph \(200\,\mathrm{km}\) away.</p>

A fuel-air mixture is sprayed into the cylinder at point 1, where the piston is at its farthest distance from the spark plug. This mixture is compressed as the piston moves toward the spark plug during the adiabatic compression stroke. The spark plug fires at point 2, releasing heat energy that had been stored in the gasoline. The fuel burns so quickly that the piston doesn't have time to move, so the heating is an isochoric process. The hot, high-pressure gas then pushes the piston outward during the power stroke. Finally, an exhaust valve opens to allow the gas temperature and pressure to drop back to their initial values before starting the cycle over again. Use the adiabatic connection between $T_1$ and $T_2$ and also between $T_3$ and $T_4$ to show that the thermal efficiency of the Otto cycle is $\eta = 1 - \frac{1}{r^{(\gamma - 1)}}$ where $r = V_{	ext{max}} / V_{	ext{min}}$ is the engine's compression ratio.</p>

        <p class="mathjax-content"><strong>Question 439</strong>: <img src="../data/images_all/843.png" alt="Question Image 439">Figure shows the Diesel cycle. It is similar to the Otto cycle (see Problem CP19.71), but there are two important differences. First, the fuel is not admitted until the air is fully compressed at point 2. Because of the high temperature at the end of an adiabatic compression, the fuel begins to burn spontaneously. (There are no spark plugs in a diesel engine!) Second, combustion takes place more slowly, with fuel continuing to be injected. This makes the ignition stage a constant-pressure process. The cycle shown, for one cylinder of a diesel engine, has a displacement $V_{\text{max}} - V_{	ext{min}}$ of $1000 \, \text{cm}^3$ and a compression ratio $r = V_{\text{max}} / V_{\text{min}} = 21$. These are typical values for a diesel truck. The engine operates with intake air ($\gamma = 1.40$) at $25 \, ^{\circ}\text{C}$ and $1.0 \, \text{atm}$ pressure. The quantity of fuel injected into the cylinder has a heat of combustion of $1000 \, \text{J}$.

What is the energy \( E_2 \)? Assume the atoms are in a cavity between mirrors designed to reflect the green light with high efficiency but to allow the red light to leave the cavity immediately. Then stimulated emission can lead to the buildup of a collimated beam of green light between the mirrors having a greater intensity than that of the red light. To constitute the radiated laser beam, a small fraction of the green light is permitted to escape by transmission through one mirror. The mirrors forming the resonant cavity can be made of layers of silicon dioxide (index of refraction \( n = 1.458 \)) and titanium dioxide (index of refraction varies between 1.9 and 2.6).</p>

In 1925 Otto Stern used a beam of \(\text{Bi}_2\) molecules emitted from an oven at 850 K. The beam defined by slit \(\text{S}_1\) was admitted into the interior of a rotating drum via slit \(\text{S}_2\) in the drum wall. The identical bunches of molecules thus formed struck and adhered to a curved glass plate fixed to the interior drum wall, the fastest molecules striking near A, which was opposite \(\text{S}_2\), the slowest near B, and the others in between depending on their speeds. The density of the molecular deposits along the glass plate was measured with a densitometer. The density (proportional to the number of molecules) plotted against distance along the glass plate (dependent on \( v \)) made possible determination of the speed distribution. If the drum is 10 cm in diameter and is rotating at 6250 rpm. Find the distance from A where molecules traveling at \( \langle v \rangle \) will strike.</p>

When a comet approaches the Sun, the increased warmth evaporates water from the ice on the surface of the comet nucleus, producing a thin atmosphere of water vapor around the nucleus. Sunlight can then dissociate H\_2O molecules in the vapor to H atoms and OH molecules. The sunlight can also excite the OH molecules to higher energy levels. When the comet is still relatively far from the Sun, the sunlight causes equal excitation to the \( E\_2 \) and \( E\_1 \) levels. Hence, there is no population inversion between the two levels. However, as the comet approaches the Sun, the excitation to the \( E\_1 \) level decreases and population inversion occurs. The reason has to do with Fraunhofer lines. As a comet approaches the Sun, the Doppler effect due to the comet's speed relative to the Sun shifts the Fraunhofer lines in wavelength, overlapping one of them with the wavelength required for excitation to the \( E\_1 \) level in OH molecules. Population inversion occurs in those molecules, and they radiate stimulated emission at about \( 1666\text\{ MHz \} \). What was the energy difference \( E\_2 - E\_1 \) for that emission?</p>

The apparent distance $D_{app}$ traveled by the knot between the two bursts is the distance across an Earth-observer's view of the knot's path. The apparent time $T_{app}$ between the bursts is the difference in the arrival times of the light from them. The apparent speed of the knot is then $V_{app} = D_{app} / T_{app}$.  When superluminal (faster than light) jets were first observed, they seemed to defy special relativity—at least until the correct geometry was understood. Evaluate $V_{app}$ for $v = 0.980c$ and $\theta = 30.0^\circ.$</p>

The theory of scattering generalizes in a pretty obvious way to arbitrary localized potentials. To the left (Region I), $V(x) = 0$, so $$\psi(x) = Ae^{ikx} + Be^{-ikx}, \quad \text{where } k = \sqrt{\frac{2mE}{\hbar}}.$$ To the right (Region III), $V(x)$ is again zero, so $$\psi(x) = Fe^{ikx} + Ge^{-ikx}.$$ In between (Region II), of course, I can't tell you what $\psi$ is until you specify the potential, but because the Schrödinger equation is a linear, second-order differential equation, the general solution has got to be of the form $$\psi(x) = Cf(x) + Dg(x),$$ where $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are two linearly independent particular solutions. There will be four boundary conditions (two joining Regions I and II, and two joining Regions II and III). Two of these can be used to eliminate $C$ and $D$, and the other two can be "solved" for $B$ and $F$ in terms of $A$ and $G$: $$B = S_{11}A + S_{12}G, \quad F = S_{21}A + S_{22}G.$$ The four coefficients $S_{ij}$, which depend on $k$ (and hence on $E$), constitute a $2 \times 2$ matrix $\mathbf{S}$, called the scattering matrix (or $S$-matrix, for short). The $S$-matrix tells you the outgoing amplitudes ($B$ and $F$) in terms of the incoming amplitudes ($A$ and $G$): $$egin{pmatrix} B \ F \end{pmatrix} = egin{pmatrix} S_{11} & S_{12} \ S_{21} & S_{22} \end{pmatrix} egin{pmatrix} A \ G \end{pmatrix}.$$ In the typical case of scattering from the left, $G = 0$, so the reflection and transmission coefficients are $$R_L = \left| \frac{B}{A} ight|_{G=0}^2 = |S_{11}|^2, \quad T_L = \left| \frac{F}{A} ight|_{G=0}^2 = |S_{21}|^2.$$ For scattering from the right, $A = 0$, and $$R_R = \left| \frac{F}{G} ight|_{A=0}^2 = |S_{22}|^2, \quad T_R = \left| \frac{B}{G} ight|_{A=0}^2 = |S_{12}|^2.$$ Construct the $S$-matrix for scattering from a delta-function well</p>

When these atoms come together to form a metal, we get $N$ electrons in a much larger infinite square well of width $Na$.

Note: The probability here refers to the random thermal distribution, and has nothing to do with quantum indeterminacy. Quantum mechanics will only enter this problem through quantization of the energies $E_n$. A crystal consisting of $N$ atoms can be thought of as a collection of $3N$ oscillators (each atom is attached by springs to its 6 nearest neighbors, along the $x, y$, and $z$ directions, but those springs are shared by the atoms at the two ends). The heat capacity of the crystal (per atom) will therefore be $$C = 3 \frac{dar{E}}{dT}.$$ Show that (in this model) $$C = 3k_B \left( \frac{\Theta_E}{T} ight)^2 \frac{e^{\Theta_E/T}}{(e^{\Theta_E/T} - 1)^2},$$ where $\Theta_E \equiv \hbar \omega / k_B$ is the so-called Einstein temperature.

The totality of events corresponding to positions on the tube when it is lit correspond to the yellow region on the diagram. The tube is observed from the window of a rocket train passing the station from left to right at speed $v$.

Most of the molecules are $H_2$, but a small fraction of the molecules are carbon monoxide ($CO$). Such a molecular cloud in the constellation Orion is shown in figure. The upper image was made with an ordinary visible-light telescope; the lower image shows the molecular cloud in Orion as imaged with a radio telescope tuned to a wavelength emitted by $CO$ in a rotational transition. The different colors in the radio image indicate regions of the cloud that are moving either toward us (blue) or away from us (red) relative to the motion of the cloud as a whole, as determined by the Doppler shift of the radiation. (Since a molecular cloud has about $10,000$ hydrogen molecules for each $CO$ molecule, it might seem more reasonable to tune a radio telescope to emissions from $H_2$ than to emissions from $CO$. Unfortunately, it turns out that the $H_2$ molecules in molecular clouds do not radiate in either the radio or visible portions of the electromagnetic spectrum.) $I_{CO} = 1.449 \times 10^{-46}\ kg \cdot m^2$, calculate the wavelength of the photon emitted by a $CO$ molecule in an $l=1 \to l=0$ rotational transition.</p>

The dust particles are released from rest above a $1.0$-$\mu m$-diameter hole, fall through the hole (there's just barely room for the particles to go through), and land on a detector at distance $d$ below. Quantum effects would be noticeable if the detection-circle diameter increased by 10\% to $1.1$ $\mu m$. At what distance $d$ would the detector need to be placed to observe this increase in the diameter?</p>
